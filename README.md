# Rift-DeleteAllGuildFinderMessages-Addon

This one deletes all guild finder mails marked as read (with a 'force' flag to delete the guild finder messages marked as unread as well).

Command to delete all read guild finder mails but leave the unread ones:
```
/gfdelete
```

Alternatively, to delete all guild finder mails including the unread ones:
```
/gfdelete force
```

This will only delete the guild finder mails and nothing else.
Also works for guild finder mails sent from French and German characters, as well.
